Written for integration with the rest of the T4 software stack.

## Build the wheel

_Packaging and build references here: Packaging references here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/_

- Ensure `pyproject.toml` is up to date. Reference here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/
- Ensure you have python3.7+, pip and venv (`apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv`), and build (`pip3 install --upgrade build`) installed.
- Build the wheel
  `python3 -m build`

## Build and publish the server Docker image

- Move the wheel from ./dist/matchmaker-0.X.X-py3-none-any.whl into ./docker_setup/.
- Ensure `build.dockerfile` is updated, particularly ensuring MATCHMAKER_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET, MATCHMAKER_HASURA_URL, and MATCHMAKER_DOMAIN are set correctly.
- From ./docker_setup/, build the Docker image.
  `docker build -t matchmaker:latest -f .\build.dockerfile .`
- Log Docker into AWS private ECR registry (requires AWS CLI configured and authorized for the private registry).
  `aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS \`
  `--password-stdin ACCT_ID_NUMBER.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
- Push the Docker image to the private registry.
  `docker tag matchmaker:latest \`
  `ACCT_ID_NUMBER.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com matchmaker:latest`
  `docker push ACCT_ID_NUMBER.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/matchmaker:latest`

## Update App Runner with the new build
